# EtchASketch

Simple sketchpad or Etch-A-Sketch website made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Click on a grid size to choose the size of your grid or to reset your canvas. Choose a color from the color palet, click the black button for black, and click the multi-color button to get a series of random colors. To draw, click on a square and drag you mouse. Click again on yor final square to stop drawing.

Bugs to address later:
- can go from multi-color button or eraser to black button (have to change the color on the color picker in between)
- add toggle function using jQuery to add a border around a button when it is clicked/active
